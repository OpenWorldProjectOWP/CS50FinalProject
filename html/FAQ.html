      <h1>What Is Web Development?</h1>
      <p>Glad you asked! <span class="orange">Web development</span> refers to the actual building, deployment, and maintenance of a website. Developers (or "devs" for short) take all of the puzzle pieces of website building and, using an <span class="blue">arsenal</span> of <span class="yellow">tools</span>, provide the finished picture for the world to enjoy.</p>

        <h1>Why Do I Need A Dev?</h1>
        <p>In todays world, more and more people are choosing to browse businesses and service options via the web. When a business lacks an <span class="orange">online presence</span> it is missing out on the ability to reach <span class="blue">millions of potential customers!</span> Also, having a website listed alongside your business info <span class="yellow">builds trust</span> with potential customers that want to see what you are all about before they decide if your service is what they are looking for.</p>

        <h1>Why Choose A Freelancer?</h1>
        <p>Did you know that hiring a full-time dev can cost <span class="orange">$60,000 per year?</span> And that's on the low end of the average! A freelancer can provide the same quality website and provide updates whenever you need them for a fraction of the cost.That's money in the bank! Also, hiring a freelancer helps you avoid those pesky taxes that come with having employees! A freelancer relies heavily on <span class="blue">customer experiences</span> to keep their business going, so freelancers typically feel more compelled to <span class="yellow">go above and beyond</span> your expectations!</p>
